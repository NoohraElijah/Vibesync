# Vibesync

## Vision
**Vibesync** is a visionary platform that merges **music and technology**-powered by full-stack engineering and AI- to revolutionalize how artists,songwriters, and producers create,collaborate,and distribute their music. It's a space where creativity meets intelligence.

## Inspiration
As a deep-thinking individual with strong passions in both **computer science** and **music**, I envisioned a future where artists wouldn't need to switch between scattered tools. Instead, they'd have one smart platform to:
- Write songs
- Generate AI-based lyrics or beats
- Analyze musical emotion
- Collaborate with other creatives
- Build their portfolio
- Share and distribute music globally

This idea was initiated and documented by me, **Addo Boakye Elijah**, on **April 23,2025**, while in my second year first semester as a computer science and music dual student.

## Key Features (Planned)
- AI-powered lyric generation
- Beat and chord progression suggestion
- Smart voice-to-MIDI or beat conversion
- Real-time collaborative songwriting editor
- AI music emotion and genre analyzer
- Portfolio builder for artists and producers
- One-click music distribution with smart tagging
- Social layer for artist-to-artist connection

## Why it's different
While some platforms focus on **just creation** or **just distribution**, Vibesync will be:
- **All-in-one**
- **AI-integrated**
- **Artist-centered**
- **Built mobile-first**

It's more than a tool- it's a movement for the next generation of creatives.

## Current Progress
- Vision published on GitHub
- Repository initialized
- Building frontend (React Native)
- Backend logic (Firebase)
- AI integration planning (Python)
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version

  ## Tech stack (Planned)
- Frontend: React Native (Mobile-first)
- Backend: Firebase / Node.js
- AI/ML: Python (for NLP + audio)
- Database: Firestore / Vercel

 ## About me
 I'm a second-year CS student and music school student. I've written over **50 songs** and want to build tools that empower creators like me- while working toward a **billionaire vision** of launching a world-changing music-tech company.
